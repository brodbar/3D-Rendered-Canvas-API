# 3D-Rendered-Canvas-API
It started as a fun project during my first year in engineering. I just wanted to see how parametrized curves would look like in third dimensional world. Now it evolved to something like this.

Since I wanted to challenge myself I intentonally avoided using WebGL or any frameworks.
